The first repository from WebProject subject.
It contains the following Python3 projects:
- A simple example of Web Scraping from Banggood's Flashdeals.
- An API example from Open Weather Map API.
- A simple example of Web Scraping from EPS.

The Banggood Web Scrapper can be run with the following command:
```
python3 webclient_banggood.py
```
It prints the title, price and old price from the products in the page.
Since the data is yielded as a dictionary type, it should be easy to
add more features such as sending the data through Telegram.
